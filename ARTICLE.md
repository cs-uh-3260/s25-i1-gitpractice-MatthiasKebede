## Thoughts

<p> Over the past several years of studying computer science, I have exposed myself to more and more different operating systems, architectures, and programming languages. I chose this article since I felt it was a brief yet fairly comprehensive glimpse at the many facets involved in maintaining the portability of your software, and accommodating for the many environments it may have to run on. The content itself is explained simply while still getting the point across, and there are helpful tidbits like code snippets and examples of tools or techniques you can use. </p>
